# Coursera Certificate Validation Tool

This software helps Individuals/Teachers to validate and verify coursera certificates
and store the results in an excel sheet to make it easier to view file integrity.
This tool is built on a Command Line Interface, unlike my previous
tool [RONEE](https://akvrv.com/), I believe this type of Interface will be suitable for this
software since it reduces memory usage than compared to a
GUI with bells and whistles, this software is straight to point, 
easy and very powerful (I actually made a lot of effort to optimize)

This Software is Free to Use as an individual, but modifying, tampering
this software is a serious offence

I did not intend to include any trojan, backdoor or ransomware to
this software, if your antivirus detects that my software is malicious
it is purely a fluke, I do not intend to cause harm to any individual/system


## Features

- üîê 4 Layer Verification Algorithm
- ‚è≥ Offline verification
- üíª Web database based verification
- üí™ Binary data analysis
- üçÉ Support for all modern PDF versions

## FAQ

#### Why is the software not running in my Mac machine?

This project is developed for windows users in mind, but a Mac version is
well under development, wait for updates

#### Where is the source code?

Yes, I believe and support open source, I built this software for open source
but due to some complications, the code which I wrote can be misused for other reasons
if made public, hence I didn't openly release the source code to the public, but if you
really need to see the source, I will surely do it, but I will not give the files for
redistribution, modification, unauthorised release etc.

Please read the [licence](https://github.com/akvrohitvarma/coursera-certificate-validator/blob/master/LICENSE) carefully

(publicly available student data must be used carefully)

#### Is it virus? Is it a Trojan?

I never worked to make this Software as a Trojan or a Virus, 
for the amount of work and effort I kept in this tool, I never 
intended to make/bind a malware trojan to harm others, the only reason
I didn't release the source code is because I don't want to tamper privacy 
of others.

You can install [Glasswire](https://www.glasswire.com/) or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
and analyze the requests made by my software, the only request it makes is to the 
results server, you can scan my software in sandboxes like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)
but beware there maybe false positives saying my software is a malware, because I don't software firm, I'm still a student

You can check VirusTotal results by clicking [here](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c7326852edc233e197ed015f0a787c0291a29eb8867f3ce033a360038545e14c/detection)
